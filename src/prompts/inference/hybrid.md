{context}

Question: {question}

The context has two sections:
- RETRIEVED FACTS: structured extracted facts (check these first)
- RAW CONTEXT: source text excerpts with full details

Step-by-step:
1. Find relevant facts in RETRIEVED FACTS
2. If facts lack specific details (step numbers, coordinates, exact names, sequences) — check RAW CONTEXT for the missing details
3. Combine both to answer precisely
4. If the answer requires a short bridge across 2-3 facts or raw lines, do that explicitly instead of saying the answer is missing
5. If multiple lines from the SAME EPISODE describe the same event, entity, or outcome, combine them into one grounded answer
6. If RAW CONTEXT explicitly names an action, command, or ordered step outcome, trust that explicit label over a second-order inference from surrounding state descriptions
7. For short ordered action sequences, compute the net effect from the stated actions unless the question explicitly asks about a separate object/state change

CONFLICT RESOLUTION:
Never use session number alone to resolve contradictions.
Use a fact as newer/current only if the evidence explicitly says it is newer/current/replaces another fact, or if an explicit date/version/status proves it.
If the evidence does not prove which fact supersedes the other, report the conflict or answer from the strongest directly relevant evidence.

Answer based only on the context above. Be concise and direct.
If the facts don't contain the answer, say what you can infer from them.
